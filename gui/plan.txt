Proposed GUI Structure (focused on real-time congestion forecasting)
PAGE 1 — City Live Forecast Dashboard (the core feature)

A real-time dynamic dashboard updated every X minutes.

Top section (3 cards)

Current Congestion Level (with color coding)

Next Hour Forecast (average city-wide or zone-based)

Weather Snapshot (temp, precip, conditions)

Center: Interactive Map

A map layer that shows:

current congestion from the API (real-time)

predicted congestion (time selectable)

maybe a slider (hour 0 → hour +12)

Visual cues:

green: free flow

yellow/orange: moderate

red/dark red: heavy

pulses for predicted hotspots

You can use:

Folium

Kepler.gl

Deck.gl (PyDeck)

Plotly scatter_mapbox

PyDeck is best for performance and polish.

Bottom: Real-time timeline chart

A line plot:

current data

next X hours of forecast

uncertainty band (optional)

This page alone is already PhD-level portfolio worthy.

PAGE 2 — Per-Route Traffic Forecast

This is the “itinerary time-loss” tool you mentioned.
This is very impressive and a differentiating feature.

User inputs:

Starting point (search bar or map click)

Destination (search bar or map click)

Travel mode (car)

Departure time (now or future time)

Behind the scenes:

Call a routing API (OpenRouteService or OSRM)

Get polyline coordinates

For each road segment:

get its current congestion

get predicted congestion at departure time

Compute:

base travel time

congestion-adjusted travel time

total extra delay

alternative route suggestions (optional)

Output:

Highlight the selected route on the map

Show segments colored by predicted congestion

Text summary:

Estimated travel time: 23 min
Forecasted congestion delay: +6.4 min
Expected arrival: 14:41
Risk of heavy congestion: 32%


Recruiters / professors love this because it looks like a real application.

PAGE 3 — Weather-Integrated Forecast

Since congestion is influenced by weather, you show:

Elements:

Next 12–24 hours weather forecast (via OpenWeather)

Predicted congestion timeline

Correlation (optional)

Toggle to simulate scenarios:

If precipitation doubles → congestion +X%
If temperature drops → congestion -Y%


This shows your understanding of interaction between features and outputs, which is great for ML positions.

PAGE 4 — System Controls (Optional)

For engineering demonstration:

Refresh interval

Model version selector

Real-time inference logs

API health

This is very useful if you want to present it to a committee or company.

🎨 Design principles (to look professional)

Dark theme for maps (Mapbox Dark, OpenStreetMap Dark)

Color scale consistent across all components

Cards for KPIs

Side panel for parameters (like a real dashboard)

Top bar with city / date / refresh indicator

🔧 What tools to use in Streamlit
Maps

PyDeck (best):

GPU-accelerated

handles thousands of road segments

beautiful layers

Alternative: Kepler.gl plugin (stunning but less flexible).

Geocoding / Routing

OpenRouteService (free, supports polylines + segment-level info)

OSRM (open-source)

ORS is easier for Python.

Weather

OpenWeather OneCall API

MeteoBlue

Tomorrow.io (best but paid)

Congestion real-time

Depending on your source:

City-provided API

TomTom Traffic

HERE Traffic

Google Maps Traffic (not official, not free)

Your own historical + nowcast model to fill in missing roads

📚 What this teaches you (VERY valuable for applications)

geospatial data engineering

real-time pipelines

API integration

time-series forecasting

model serving

UI/UX for scientific apps

multi-source data fusion (weather + traffic + routes)

This is a rare combination and looks extremely strong in a PhD or ML job application.

🚀 Next step

We can now:

Option A — Build the GUI architecture blueprint (page-by-page components)
Option B — Generate the Streamlit file structure
Option C — Write the minimal running version (mock data, map + forecast slider)
Option D — Integrate real routing with OpenRouteService (complex but amazing)

Choose one and we start coding it.
